# Inventory-Management
An Inventory Management System made in PyQt5, running on Pandas. Includes managing vendors, various graphs, and a billing system(more features to be added).
1. Prerequisites: You must have pandas, pyqt5, matplotlib, and numpy installed.
2. How to run: Just the run the main file, with all other files intact in the same structure as the branch. All other storage files will be generated automatically.
3. Couple things you need to know: "Main database" refers to the main save file, where your inventory is being stored. "Raw Database" is a pre-defined file of comma-seperated values, which can be used to add items to the inventory quickly. It's usage is optional. "Vendors database" refers to the database where all vendor-related information is being stored.

Note: This project was built around a medicine database, which is why several variable names such as drugs_list, etc. can be observed throughout the program. However, the program is highly generic, and can run in any sort of atmosphere.
